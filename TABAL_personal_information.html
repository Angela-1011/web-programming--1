    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><p>Hello! My name is Angela Tabal. I am 18 years old. I enjoy a variety of hobbies and have some favorite things that define who I am. Here’s a quick overview of a few things I love:</p>

    <p>One of my biggest passions is watching Kdramas. I love how the stories unfold, the emotional depth of the characters, and the unique blend of drama, romance, and comedy. It’s more than just entertainment for me; it’s a way to relax and connect with stories from a different culture.</p>
    
    <p>My favorite color is pink, which reflects my joyful and optimistic personality. Pink is a color that makes me feel warm and happy, and I tend to choose it in my everyday life, from my clothing to the way I style my room.</p>
    
    <p>Whenever I get a chance, I love being surrounded by nature. There’s something incredibly peaceful about being outdoors, whether it’s a walk in the park or spending time in the mountains. Nature recharges me, helping me clear my mind and find balance in my busy life.</p>
    
    <p>I’m always excited to explore new interests and grow in different ways, so this is just a glimpse into the things that make me who I am today. I look forward to discovering even more things I’m passionate about in the future!</p>
